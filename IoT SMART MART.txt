The name of our Project was SmartMart. It prosposed a solution for the problems in the Retail industry.
Few of the Hardwares used were Weight Sensors, EP8266 Wifi Module, AVR Development Board, etc. 
Softwares used were Atmel Studio, AVR Dude and ThingsSpeak Platform.
The project had two parts i.e. Smart Cart and Weight Sensor Shelves.
The project helped in keeping track of products in a store which will curb the problem of misplaced items. 
It also sent real time updates of stock using the ThingsSpeak platform which would enable retailers to restock shelves as and when required.
The SmartCart counts the number of items added using the RFID Tags and reader, and automatically display the amount to be paid by customer.
